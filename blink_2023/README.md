Major Events journal for the Summer of 2023 Migraine Blink Study

Provide date-stamped and initialed entries that document major events that occur during the experiment. This could include when data from the first subject is collected, or if it is necessary to change an aspect of the experiment once it has started, or if a subject is excluded for some reason.

29-June-2023 -- Major events document created. GKA

11-July-2023 -- Facebook ad was posted with a 24-hour duration. Originally, it was rejected (Facebook believed it to be an employment opportunity ad). Ad was re-submitted for manual review and was approved later that same day. Facebook ad began running. GGF

12-July-2023 -- Facebook ad ended. Reach: 587 accounts. Link clicks: 24. Number of responses: 12. GGF

13-July-2023 -- Received an extra POEM response. First two participants have been contacted for pilot study: 1 HF and 1 MwoA under expanded inclusion criteria. GGF

17-July-2023 -- First pilot subject (MwoA under expanded inclusion criteria) has been scheduled for 07/19/23. GGF

19-July-2023 -- First pilot subject completed session 1. Subject completed "Headache Diary.docx" during visit, from memory. GGF

20-July-2023 -- Contacted another HaF participant for pilot study. GGF

24-July-2023 -- First pilot subject completed their Post-Session Questionnaire. Contacted two more HaF participants for pilot study. GGF

27-July-2023 -- Second pilot subject (MwA) completed session 1. Subject mentioned having a migraine earlier that day and that their vision felt a little blurrier during collection of BCVA because of their earlier migraine. Subject said this is common for them. Subject was short on time so Debrief Google Form was not completed in session but was sent via email instead. No technical difficulties! GGF

02-Aug-2023 -- Third and final pilot subject (HaF) completed session 1. Subject mentioned feeling sleepy throughout the experiment. Subject also mentioned being able to hear the air puffs but only at the exact moment of impact and that the sound did not help them anticipate when an air puff would arrive. Updated preregistration exclusion criteria (anyone with a history of using hard contact lenses or an inability to discontinue use of soft contact lenses in the 2 weeks prior to a session will be excluded from our study). GGF

07-Aug-2023 -- Pre-registration form has been finalized by GKA and GGF. GGF

08-Aug-2023 -- Facebook ad was posted. Ad was rejected. Submitted for review. GGF

09-Aug-2023 -- Facebook ad was rejected again. Working it out with support team. GGF

10-Aug-2023 -- Facebook ad is still being rejected. Facebook ad is now running. Pre-registration form has been finalized by GKA and EAK (final updates: number of subjects in total is now 40). GGF

14-Aug-2023 -- After running the Facebook ad for a few days and analyzing the POEM results, we found that the subject yield for the migraine arm of our study was too low relative to the overall POEM response rate. We have modified our inclusion criteria for the migraine arm of our study (ASC score of 4 or greater, no inter-ictal allodynia requirement, and 3 subject preferences) and these changes are reflected in our pre-registration form. GGF

15-Aug-2023 -- EyeStat device was mailed over to BlinkCNS in order to increase internal storage capacity. GGF

25-Aug-2023 -- EyeStat device has returned to the lab! GGF

30-Aug-2023 -- Pre-registration has been officially posted for public view! BlinkCNS has helped us get the EyeStat device to save video data files into local storage again! Wait times in between scans are now taking closer to 1 minute, an improvement from yesterday. The pressure regulator does not want to go above 0 PSI anymore. It was working yesterday and the device has not been moved from the tripod. Changing the canister has not done the trick so it is possible there might be a leak somewhere. Contacted Mike Suplick to help us identify any possible leaks or issues. GGF

31-Aug-2023 -- Mike helped us identify and fix the issue. The pressure regulator was not fully puncturing through the CO2 canisters. The issue has been fixed and we are up and running again! Our first official subject (HaF) is scheduled to come in tomorrow! GGF

01-Sep-2023 -- BLNK_0014 (HaF) arrived for their session. The minimum requirement for BCVA was not met on their right eye, thus the subject was excluded and the session was ended prematurely without collecting blink data. The subject was paid for their time. GGF

06-Sep-2023 -- We clarified that the enrollment criteria require *best-corrected* visual acuity to be 20/25 or better. It is possible that the BLNK_0014 participant simply requires adequate refraction. Updated the protocol to make clear that we can provide trial lenses or a pinhole to the subject in an attempt to reach the criterion acuity. We also reviewed the cut-off "OSDI" (dry eye) score that we are using for enrollment. We had picked a single value as a threshold; above this score we regarded the subject as having dry eye of sufficient severity that we did not wish to enroll them. Examination of the interpretation of the OSDI score, however, reveals that severity is judged based upon the sum score of all questions answered, and the OSDI score. We therefore modified the enrollment criteria to exclude participants whose OSDI score is greater than 10 + 2x, where x is the sum of scores. This excludes people in the mid-range of moderate severity and above. We have not yet studied our first subject, so we do not regard this as a post-hoc change in our pre-registration.

07-Sep-2023 -- BLNK_0007 (MwoA) arrived for their session and we were able to finish the entire protocol (i.e., we got data from our first non-pilot subject)! We performed the demo scan a couple times to make sure the air puffs were landing at the correct spot for each eye. At one point during the demo scan, I was concerned the digital meter and variable regulator were out of sync as the digital meter was reading a different number from what I had chosen using the variable regulator. Fortunately, both devices were in sync and working correctly. The digital meter had been in a different setting (reading BAR instead of PSI), hence the mismatch. This happened during the demo scan and I was always reading the variable regulator reading so the PSI levels and data are accurate. The rest of the session went smoothly and according to plan. The subject was able to hear the air puffs but only at the time of impact and said it did not help them anticipate the puffs. With regards to the previous entry, we further specified that our above formula for finding an OSDI enrollment cutoff (10 + 2x) only holds for x that are less than or equal to 25. If the subject has a sum of scores greater than 25, then they are excluded from participating, regardless of the formula output. This detail has been included in our preregistration document and does not change the eligibility of any of our current subjects, but further specifies our OSDI limit moving forward. GGF

08-Sep-2023 -- Made two small changes to the DayofVisitProtocol: 1) We let all subjects know that they may hold on to the tripod to stabilize themselves if the air puffs startle them. This has been changed to asking all subjects to hold on to the tripod. Subjects have done this already so it might be better to maintain consistency with this so that we do not get different data from those who hold onto the tripod and those who don't. This hasn't been the case, but this little modification will help us be on the safe side. 2) During yerterday's session, it was a little hard getting the subject's eyes to align with the line that displays on the screen of the EyeStat device. After every scan, the subject removes their face from the eyepiece when I pause the brown noise, but this then makes it so that we go through the alignment process again when we are about to start a new scan. Yesterday's subject mentioned that it would be more helpful if they could just keep their face on the eyepiece for the remainder of the block of 5 scans, since they only removed their face very briefly anyway and keeping their face there helped with alignment. This small change also does not change our data, but instead helps reduce the time it takes to align a subject and makes the process smoother. GGF

14-Sep-2023 -- BLNK_0021's (HaF) session ended prematurely because their BCVA for left and right eye while wearing their prescription glasses did not meet our eligibility criteria. We tried a couple of trial lenses but were not able to achieve an eligible BCVA. Subject said it had been a while since they had gone to the eye doctor so they intend to get an updated pair of prescription glasses and hope to participte in the study sometime later in the year when we can check their BCVA with their updated prescription glasses. No blink data was collected. GGF

18-Sep-2023 -- BLNK_0014 (HaF) returned for their redo session with their prescription glasses and met BCVA requirement on both eyes. We were able to complete the Day of Visit Protocol without any issues! GGF

20-Sep-2023 -- The BlinkTbiMainApp.exe application froze during scan 20 of BLNK_0018's (MwoA) session. I restarted the application and the device entirely and we were able to resume the session within 10 minutes. GGF

21-Sep-2023 -- BLNK_0017 (MwA) came in for their session. The BlinkTbiMainApp.exe application was processing scans very slowly. I restarted the application and the device entirely but the processing was still taking very long. To be clear, the device itself was not slow, it was only the application during the processing phases that was running slow. In other words, the scans themselves (during which the air puffs are being blown) were running at normal speeds, but the processing that happens immediately after a scan ends was taking a very long time. The processing usually takes 30-90 seconds per scan, but today there were times when the processing for a single scan took as long as 6-7 minutes to finish before we could perform the next scan. As a result, it took 2 hours to perform the 26 scans, when it usually takes a little over an hour. Overall, with all other tasks in mind, this resulted in a 3-hour session for the subject. During scan 13 of the session, the scan failed but this was detected immediately and we redid the scan. GGF

25-Sep-2023 -- During today's session, the BlinkTbiMainApp.exe application still processed some scans very slowly (the longest taking 7 minutes), but this was a lot less frequent than last session. The majority of the scans processed very quickly actually so they were able to balance each other out and we were able to complete the session within time! GGF

27-Sep-2023 -- BLNK_0021 (HaF) returned for their redo session with their new prescription glasses and met BCVA requirement on both eyes. We were able to complete the Day of Visit Protocol. The BlinkTbiMainApp.exe application is still processing some scans very slowly. GGF

29-Sep-2023 -- The scan processing went super fast this session! When about to scan, the “take baseline” button text didn’t switch over to the “scan” text after the first scan like it usually does. However, after alignment it does show the “scan” text on the button. GGF

13-Dec-2023 -- Session canceled due to excessive blinks and movement as per preregistration document. GGF

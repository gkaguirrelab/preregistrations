Major Events journal for the Summer of 2023 Migraine Blink Study

Provide date-stamped and initialed entries that document major events that occur during the experiment. This could include when data from the first subject is collected, or if it is necessary to change an aspect of the experiment once it has started, or if a subject is excluded for some reason.

29-June-2023 -- Major events document created. GKA

11-July-2023 -- Facebook ad was posted with a 24-hour duration. Originally, it was rejected (Facebook believed it to be an employment opportunity ad). Ad was re-submitted for manual review and was approved later that same day. Facebook ad began running. GGF

12-July-2023 -- Facebook ad ended. Reach: 587 accounts. Link clicks: 24. Number of responses: 12. GGF

13-July-2023 -- Received an extra POEM response. First two participants have been contacted for pilot study: 1 HF and 1 MwoA under expanded inclusion criteria. GGF

17-July-2023 -- First pilot subject (MwoA under expanded inclusion criteria) has been scheduled for 07/19/23. GGF

19-July-2023 -- First pilot subject completed session 1. Subject completed "Headache Diary.docx" during visit, from memory. GGF

20-July-2023 -- Contacted another HaF participant for pilot study. GGF

24-July-2023 -- First pilot subject completed their Post-Session Questionnaire. Contacted two more HaF participants for pilot study. GGF

27-July-2023 -- Second pilot subject (MwA) completed session 1. Subject mentioned having a migraine earlier that day and that their vision felt a little blurrier during collection of BCVA because of their earlier migraine. Subject said this is common for them. Subject was short on time so Debrief Google Form was not completed in session but was sent via email instead. No technical difficulties! GGF

02-Aug-2023 -- Third and final pilot subject (HaF) completed session 1. Subject mentioned feeling sleepy throughout the experiment. Subject also mentioned being able to hear the air puffs but only at the exact moment of impact and that the sound did not help them anticipate when an air puff would arrive. Updated preregistration exclusion criteria (anyone with a history of using hard contact lenses or an inability to discontinue use of soft contact lenses in the 2 weeks prior to a session will be excluded from our study). GGF

07-Aug-2023 -- Pre-registration form has been finalized by GKA and GGF. GGF

08-Aug-2023 -- Facebook ad was posted. Ad was rejected. Submitted for review. GGF

09-Aug-2023 -- Facebook ad was rejected again. Working it out with support team. GGF

10-Aug-2023 -- Facebook ad is still being rejected. Facebook ad is now running. Pre-registration form has been finalized by GKA and EAK (final updates: number of subjects in total is now 40). GGF

14-Aug-2023 -- After running the Facebook ad for a few days and analyzing the POEM results, we found that the subject yield for the migraine arm of our study was too low relative to the overall POEM response rate. We have modified our inclusion criteria for the migraine arm of our study (ASC score of 4 or greater, no inter-ictal allodynia requirement, and 3 subject preferences) and these changes are reflected in our pre-registration form. GGF

15-Aug-2023 -- EyeStat device was mailed over to BlinkCNS in order to increase internal storage capacity. GGF

25-Aug-2023 -- EyeStat device has returned to the lab! GGF

30-Aug-2023 -- Pre-registration has been officially posted for public view! BlinkCNS has helped us get the EyeStat device to save video data files into local storage again! Wait times in between scans are now taking closer to 1 minute, an improvement from yesterday. The pressure regulator does not want to go above 0 PSI anymore. It was working yesterday and the device has not been moved from the tripod. Changing the canister has not done the trick so it is possible there might be a leak somewhere. Contacted Mike Suplick to help us identify any possible leaks or issues. GGF

31-Aug-2023 -- Mike helped us identify and fix the issue. The pressure regulator was not fully puncturing through the CO2 canisters. The issue has been fixed and we are up and running again! Our first official subject (HaF) is scheduled to come in tomorrow! GGF

01-Sep-2023 -- BLNK_0014 (HaF) arrived for their session. The minimum requirement for BCVA was not met on their right eye, thus the subject was excluded and the session was ended prematurely without collecting blink data. The subject was paid for their time. GGF

06-Sep-2023 -- We clarified that the enrollment criteria require *best-corrected* visual acuity to be 20/25 or better. It is possible that the BLNK_0014 participant simply requires adequate refraction. Updated the protocol to make clear that we can provide trial lenses or a pinhole to the subject in an attempt to reach the criterion acuity. We also reviewed the cut-off "OSDI" (dry eye) score that we are using for enrollment. We had picked a single value as a threshold; above this score we regarded the subject as having dry eye of sufficient severity that we did not wish to enroll them. Examination of the interpretation of the OSDI score, however, reveals that severity is judged based upon the sum score of all questions answered, and the OSDI score. We therefore modified the enrollment criteria to exclude participants whose OSDI score is greater than 10 + 2x the sum of scores. This excludes people in the mid-range of moderate severity and above. We have not yet studied our first subject, so we do not regard this as a post-hoc change in our pre-registration.

07-Sep-2023 BLNK_0007 (MwoA) arrived for their session and we were able to finish the entire protocol! We performed the demo scan a couple times to make sure the air puffs were landing at the correct spot for each eye. The subject was able to hear the air puffs but only at the time of impact and said it did not help them anticipate the puffs.

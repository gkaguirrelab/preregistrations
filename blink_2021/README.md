Pre-registration for data collection using the BlinkCNS EyeStat device.

This study is complete. We conducted the analyses proposed in the pre-registration and the PDF file stored in this repo contains the results.

Ultimately, we analyzed the data using a different approach. The results of this separate analysis are described here:

A Kaiser, EB Haggerty, DP Garner, VY Bunya, GK Aguirre. (in revision) A measure of the corneal blink reflex to parametric variation of mechanical stimulation. Clinical Neurophysiology.

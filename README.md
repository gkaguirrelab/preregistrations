# GKAaguirre Lab experiment preregistrations

Experiments in the [GKAguirre Lab](http://gkaguirre.com) are usually [preregistered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preregistration). This page organizes links to these pre-registration documents by project. We initially made use of the [open science foundation](https://osf.io) website for this purpose, but more recently simply commit documents to this repository, which accomplishes the same goal of establishing a date-and-time stamped record of our plans prior to embarking on an experiment.

## Perception Studies

### Control Population Stimulus Nulling Experiment
This project studies the properties of melanopsin-directed spectral modulations, and asks how much cone contrast must be added to a nominally melanopsin-directed stimulus to minimize the visibility of that stimulus.  See:

### Perceptual Ratings of Light Flux, Cone-Directed and Melanopsin-Directed Light Pulses
This project records psychophysical ratings of light-flux, melanopsin and LMS directed stimuli. The goal is to determine if the different stimulus classes elicit different percepts. Data collected iunder this preregistration are described in:

### Quantifying light perception via perceptual and physiologic measures in response to melanopsin and cone stimulation in migraineurs with interictal photophobia and in headache-free control subjects
This project will determine if patients with light sensitivity due to migraine headache have increased sensitivity to cone stimulation, melanopsin stimulation, or both.

## Pupillometry Studies

### Comparison of monochromatic and silent-substitution evoked pupil responses
This project compares pupillary responses to monochromatic blue and red pulses and silent-substitution melanopsin- and cone-directed pulses.  This work was presented in poster form but we judged the contrast of the silent substitution stimuli was not high enough for us to be confident about the results. The project was continued under "Comparison of monochromatic and silent-substitution melanopsin and LMS-directed evoked pupil responses" below.

### Pupillometry measures of melanopsin contrast - maximum melanopsin and LMS contrast pulses
This project studies pupil responses to high-contrast melanopsin- and cone-directed pulses. We did not pursue these measurements through to publication, but see pupillometry data collected along with fMRI measurements ("Max Mel fMRI" below) as well as "Comparison of monochromatic and silent-substitution melanopsin and LMS-directed evoked pupil responses".

### A comparison of pupil and perceptual responses to photoreceptor directed stimulation in trichromats and deuteranopes
This project involves making measurements of responses to photoreceptor directed stimulation in dueteranopes. The project has two main aims: 1) understand the extent to which deuteranopes behave similarly to trichromatic controls and 2) determine how responses change in deuteranopes as contrast is increased past 400% (the maximum contrast we are able to deliver to trichromatic observers).

### Human Connectomes in Low Vision -- control subjects
We have been collecting structural and functional MRI data from normally sighted subjects as part of a Human Connectome Project entitled [Human Connectomes in Low Vision](https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/crhd-human-connectomes-low-vision-blindness-and-sight-restoration). We preregistered our protocol for retaining scanner acquisitions and subjects.

Pre-registration:

### MaxMelTiming
In this experiment, we aim to characterize the linear and nonlinear response properties of the cortical response to melanopsin stimulation. We are specifically intersted in the temporal responses of the melanopsin system, and the extent to which they differ from cone-mediated responses. After initial data collection in 2019, the project was put on hold.

## ssVEP Study

### Cortical hyper-responsivity in migraine with visual aura: effects of temporal frequency and post-receptoral channel
This project compares visual discomfort and steady state visual evoked responses (ssVEP) elicited by LMS, L-M, and S directed stimuli flickering at a range of temporal frequencies in subjects with migraine with visual aura and headache free controls.

The main goals of this project:
- Evaluate the relationship between visual discomfort and neural activity in early cortex across a range of stimulus conditions

## Evaluations
  
### POEM – Penn Online Evaluation of Migraine: An automated, web-based tool to classify subjects for migraine research
We developed an online, branching logic questionnaire and [open-source analysis software](https://github.com/gkaguirrelab/POEM) to support the automated classification of headache symptoms based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (beta). This pre-registration document describes our effort to validate the tool against prior classifications made by a neurologist in a cohort of research subjects. The outcome of this project is described here:

## Perception Studies

### Control Population Stimulus Nulling Experiment 
This project studies the properties of melanopsin-directed spectral modulations, and asks how much cone contrast must be added to a nominally melanopsin-directed stimulus to minimize the visibility of that stimulus.  See:
  - Spitschan M, Datta R, Stern AM, Brainard DH, Aguirre GK (2016) Human visual cortex responses to rapid cone and melanopsin-directed icker. Journal of Neuroscience 36(5):1471 1482.

### Perceptual Ratings of Light Flux, Cone-Directed and Melanopsin-Directed Light Pulses
This project records psychophysical ratings of light-flux, melanopsin and LMS directed stimuli. The goal is to determine if the different stimulus classes elicit different percepts. Data collected iunder this preregistration are described in:
  - Spitschan, M., Bock, A. S., Ryan, J., Frazzetta, G., Brainard, D. H., Aguirre, G. K. (2017). The human visual cortex response to melanopsin-directed stimulation is accompanied by a distinct perceptual experience. PNAS, 114(46), 1229112296, doi: 10.1073/pnas.1711522114.

## Quantifying light perception via perceptual and physiologic measures in response to melanopsin and cone stimulation in migraineurs with interictal photophobia and in headache-free control subjects
This project will determine if patients with light sensitivity due to migraine headache have increased sensitivity to cone stimulation, melanopsin stimulation, or both.

## Pupillometry Studies

### Comparison of monochromatic and silent-substitution evoked pupil responses
This project compares pupillary responses to monochromatic blue and red pulses and silent-substitution melanopsin- and cone-directed pulses.  This work was presented in poster form but we judged the contrast of the silent substitution stimuli was not high enough for us to be confident about the results. The project was continued under "Comparison of monochromatic and silent-substitution melanopsin and LMS-directed evoked pupil responses" below.

### Pupillometry measures of melanopsin contrast - maximum melanopsin and LMS contrast pulses
This project studies pupil responses to high-contrast melanopsin- and cone-directed pulses. We did not pursue these measurements through to publication, but see pupillometry data collected along with fMRI measurements ("Max Mel fMRI" below) as well as "Comparison of monochromatic and silent-substitution melanopsin and LMS-directed evoked pupil responses".

### Comparison of monochromatic and silent-substitution melanopsin and LMS-directed evoked pupil responses
In this experiment, we are comparing pupil responses evoked by monochromatic blue and red light pulses to those evoked by silent substitution LMS-directed and melanopsin-directed stimuli. The work preregistered here is described in:

### Quantifying light perception via perceptual and physiologic measures in response to melanopsin and cone stimulation in migraineurs with interictal photophobia and in headache-free control subjects
This project examined if patients with light sensitivity due to migraine headache have increased sensitivity to cone stimulation, melanopsin stimulation, or both.
